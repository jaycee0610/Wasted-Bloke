                <p>"Welcome to WASTED Bloke's
                    corner of the internet, where we
                    tackle life's serious issues with a
                    smile and a side of sarcasm!</p>


                <p>In a world where neglect,
                    inequality, and misplaced
                    priorities seem to dominate the
                    headlines, it's easy to feel
                    overwhelmed. But here, we
                    believe in the power of humor
                    and humanity to spark
                    meaningful change, even in our
                    little corner of the world.</p>

                <p>Join me as we shine a light
                    on societal absurdities,
                    challenge the status quo,
                    and advocate for a more
                    compassionate and
                    equitable society.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether it's through raising
                    awareness, supporting
                    worthy causes, or simply
                    spreading kindness one
                    meme at a time, let's show
                    the world that laughter and
                    empathy are powerful tools
                    for positive transformation.

                    This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing
                    as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
                <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you
                    refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p>

                <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never
                    was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the
                    meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
                    gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
                    stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear
                    the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable
                    forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own

                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
                    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                    see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>

                <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
                    looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
                    although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
                    samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
                    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff
                    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
                    window at the dull weather. </p>
